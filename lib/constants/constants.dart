      '''Hi, I'm Taha Khan—a dedicated mobile app developer with a strong focus on Flutter. I specialize in building modern, user-friendly, and high-performance applications that run seamlessly across both Android and iOS.

With experience working on more than 10 production-level apps, I’ve tackled a wide range of real-world features including in-app purchases, socket-based real-time communication, deep links and universal links, and Google Maps integration.

I enjoy the entire process of turning ideas into polished, responsive mobile experiences. From writing clean, maintainable code to optimizing performance and refining UI/UX details, I take pride in delivering apps that feel smooth and intuitive.

In addition to Flutter and Dart, I work with tools and technologies like Firebase, REST APIs, and Git to build scalable and reliable applications that provide real value.'''
